# General structure

Data from `../py` is stored in `raw_data`. Data from `processing` is stored in `processed_data`. 

`raw_data` is further divided into `csv` and `json`, the destinations of `../py/scraping`/`../py/fetching` and `../py/json_creators`, respectively. 

`raw_data` also contains `learnsets.js` and `gen2learnsets.js`, copied from the [Pokemon Showdown GitHub page](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/tree/master/data).
