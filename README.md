The goal of this code is to set up a MySQL backend for a GraphQL API, to be used in Pokemon apps. The data herein is focused around competitive Pokemon, and is mostly scraped from Bulbapedia, among other sources. 

I have provided `README.md` files in most of the other directories explaining the role of each folder in achieving this goal. If you want to add data to this project, I have written out a detailed example on doing so across these `README.md` files. I have organized my code so as to facilitate inserting new data, and several of the conventions I have employed in processing the data are to this end. These are described in the appropriate `README.md` file.

The `README.md` file in the `src` folder describes the overall structure of this repository.
